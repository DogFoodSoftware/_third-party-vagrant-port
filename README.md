Conveyor-Vagrant-Port
---------------------

Conveyor packaging of Jordan Sissel's
[vagrant-port](https://github.com/jordansissel/vagrant-port). At the time of
packaging, the gem installed by `vagrant plugin install vagrant-port` had a
typo in a require and was un-loadable. The version on github was good, though,
so we made or own gem. Probably more reliable this way anyway.
